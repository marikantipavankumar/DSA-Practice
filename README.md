🧩 DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to my DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Practice Repository!
This repository contains all the coding problems and solutions I practice regularly to strengthen my problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews.

📂 Repository Structure

Problems are organized by topics (Arrays, Strings, Linked List, Trees, Graphs, etc.) or platforms (LeetCode, Codeforces, GeeksforGeeks, etc.).

Each file/folder includes:

Problem statement (sometimes in comments).

My solution in the respective programming language (mostly Java).

Explanations or approaches where needed.

🚀 Goals of this Repository

Improve problem-solving skills.

Build a solid understanding of core data structures and algorithms.

Prepare for coding interviews and competitive programming.

Maintain a personal record of solved problems for quick revision.

📘 Topics Covered

Arrays

Strings

Recursion & Backtracking

Linked Lists

Stacks & Queues

Trees & Binary Search Trees

Graphs

Dynamic Programming

Greedy Algorithms

Sorting & Searching

(More topics will be added as I continue practicing.)

🛠️ Languages Used

Java

Contribution

This repository is mainly for my personal practice, but if you spot any mistakes or have better approaches, feel free to open a pull request or raise an issue. Let’s learn together! 🚀

⭐ Acknowledgements

Problems sourced from LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, Codeforces, and other competitive programming platforms.

Thanks to the open-source community and countless resources that help in learning DSA.
